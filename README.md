# FoodPlanner

Simple CLI app for planning a schedule of meals for each day of the week. Made for fun and as a solution to lack of creativity in deciding what to eat. Not completely ready yet as some functions are missing implementation but the basic functionality is there.

TO-DO:

  - Adding and removing food types via application
  - Option to choose between one week or two week schedule
  - Option to choose between one meal for each day or one meal for every other day
